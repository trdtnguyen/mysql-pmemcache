# mysql-pmemcache
Optimize MySQL using PMEM caching

## Build the source code
Building the source code is done automatically by a script file named `build_mysqld.sh`.

Following below two steps:
* Step 0 (optional): Make the `bld` directory to store the buit files (if you have not done it before)
```
# mkdir bld
```
* Step 1: Setting the desired value for `BUILD_NAME` variable in `build_mysqld.sh`
* Step 2: simply run the script file.
```
# ./build_mysql.sh
```
